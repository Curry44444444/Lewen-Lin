<h1>#Learning UI Frameworks is even more complicated than a programming language!</h1>
When I was first introduced to bootstrap 5 last week I wondered, what is this thing? what is nav? Why do you need the class nav-item in front of some elements? I already learned how to add text in the page using p in HTML, why do I need to learn more in other format? Wouldn't it be redundant for me to learn this when I've already mastered html and css? After the Island Snow assignment, I was surprised when I realized that I can put the logo of facebook company using only a line of code without searching the code from outside resources, I can just copy the code "<i class="bi bi-facebook"></i>" from bootstrap 5 icons library, after that I'm starting to like the frame because it saves me a lot of time to search for outside resouces,

It's no exaggeration to say that using boostrap 5 will save you at least half the time of using raw html, instead of spending hours writing custom CSS to ensure a button looks good across different devices or wrestling with layout breakpoints, Bootstrap provides ready-made solutions that work seamlessly right out of the box. Although the early learning is very boring, but familiar with the mastery of the I reduce a lot of worries, just use a few class names to create a consistent, professional look and feel of the design, we developers can focus more on functionality and user experience, rather than trivial style issues，These understandings were gained after I got to know the first UI framework（bootstrap 5）, and I believe that my efficiency will increase after being exposed to more UI frameworks later on
