#Programming is very cool for me
I learned about computer science and programming in about 2016 when I was in middle school, but what I know was only I can develop a game using only code, I didn't have an
access to a computer at that time, so I did not do too much research on this, but when I got into high school, it has been the most popular industry in China and U.S, that's why I chose computer science as my major and took the course software engineering ICS314, even though it's a hard major but I like overcoming obstacles.

#Software engineering has changed our life
I think software engineering has profoundly transformed the modern life, it changes the way we communicate each other, the way we study and work, it makes global collaboration possible, which is hard to imagine a long time ago, and automatic tasks have make our life much more convenient, with the advent of AI, A new technological revolution has begun, that's the reason I'm so excited for this class and chose data science major.

#What kinds of skills and experiences I hope to develop in future.
I hope I can develop skills to develop a secure, efficient software in the future, I also aim to gain more hand-on experience with real world projects, I also want my code to be more readable and efficient by doing all WODs and review them usually. I believe I can survive and prosper in this class.
