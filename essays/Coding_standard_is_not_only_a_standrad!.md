<h1>Coding standard is sometimes annoying!</h1>
Coding standard can sometimes make my feel annoying, reflecting on my first week use of ESLint in VSCode, a red wavy line would occur even though it's just a minor issue, for example, it occurs when I forgot to create a new line at the end of the code or forgot to add a whitespace after the "if" statement, then I have to go back to check what happened and recorrect the mistake, to be honest, in many case I don't think it's necessary to correct them and the small issues would not affect my code, I will feel a distraction from the core logic I'm trying to implement, I cannot get a lot real value from correcting them.But however, I forgot what is the definition real value: consistency, collaboration, and long-term maintainability.

<h1>From Frustration to Growth</h1>
I think software engineering has profoundly transformed the modern life, it changes the way we communicate each other, the way we study and work, it makes global collaboration possible, which is hard to imagine a long time ago, and automatic tasks have make our life much more convenient, with the advent of AI, A new technological revolution has begun, that's the reason I'm so excited for this class and chose data science major.

<h1>#What kinds of skills and experiences I hope to develop in future.</h1>
I hope I can develop skills to develop a secure, efficient software in the future, I also aim to gain more hand-on experience with real world projects, I also want my code to be more readable and efficient by doing all WODs and review them usually. I believe I can survive and prosper in this class.
