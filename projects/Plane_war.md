For this project, I made a simple plane fighting game using the Pygame library. The player controls a plane at the bottom of the screen and shoots down enemies or obstacles flying from the top by firing bullets. The background of the game is a sky, and scores and life values are displayed in the top corners of the screen. The game features a variety of enemies, including small spaceships and asteroids, and the overall style is pixelated, similar to classic arcade games. This was my first attempt at developing a full game project using Pygame, and I learned how to handle the basics of game logic, collision detection.
